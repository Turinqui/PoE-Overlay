## Developer

### Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

#### Prerequisites

Your editor of choice for a node project - like [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

The first thing to install is [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/). Download your matching executable and follow the instructions.

Then you need to install the [windows-build-tools](https://github.com/felixrieseberg/windows-build-tools) from an elevated PowerShell or CMD.exe. This may take a while (10-15min).
```
npm install --global --production windows-build-tools
```

#### Installing

1. Clone the repository. 
2. Open up the folder with your editor.
3. Run ```npm install``` to install all required npm packages.
4. Run ```npm run robotjs:rebuild``` to generate a executable [robotjs](https://github.com/octalmage/robotjs) version.

That's it. Your Project should now be ready to run:
```
npm run start
```

### Running the tests

These are used to test for eg. the external APIs (poe.trade, poe.ninja, etc.). To run those:
```
npm run ng:test
```

#### And coding style tests

These will run certain linters to keep the project in a clean state.

```
npm run ng:lint
```

### Building

A electron executable can be generate by calling:
```
npm run electron:windows
```

### Built With

* [Electron](https://electronjs.org/) - The desktop app framework
